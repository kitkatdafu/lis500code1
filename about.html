        <h1>Haskell</h1>
        <p>
            Haskell is a purely functional programming language developed for scientific purpose (research in
            programming language and type theory), initially. Nowadays,
            companies like Facebook and Github are using Haskell to handle spamming and to analyze code written in other
            programming languages.
        </p>
        <h2>It's Name</h2>
        <p>
            Haskell is named after a famous logician Haskell Curry. Interestingly, his last name is also used to name a
            programming language. He is so famous that useful concepts of functional programming (like currying, uncurrying) is named after him.
        </p>
        <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
        <p>
            There are two programming paradigms: imperative programming and functional programming. Though the line
            between these two paradigms is not clear. For example, lambda expression (or closure), the fundamental of functional
            programming can be found in basically all mainstream programming languages. Higher-order functions like
            <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> can be easily used in Python and JavaScript.

            <h3>Lambda Calculus</h3>
            As mentioned above, lambda calculus is the fundamental of functional programming. The idea is simple. A
            function in lambda calculus is defined with a body (expression) and a parameter. We can apply the function to an
            argument. The application process essentially substitutes the variable with the same name as the parameter
            in the function body with the value to which the function is applied. For example, suppose we have a function
            <pre>
                <code>
                    λx.(x + x)
                </code>
            </pre>
            Then, applying this function to 1 results in
            <pre>
                <code>
                    λx.(x + x) => 1 + 1 => 2.
                </code>
            </pre>
            Lambda function implies that same input always produces the same output (since there is no side effect).
            <h3>Type</h3>
            Another fact about Haskell is that it has a safe type system. Each function in Haskell is associated with a
            type signature, which defined the domain and the range of the calculation. For example, the addition
            function, <code>add</code>, that adds two numbers, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, together is written as
            <code>add a b = a + b</code> in Haskell. And this function has a type of <code>Int -> Int -> Int</code>,
            indicating that the two arguments of this function have a type of <code>Int</code> and the result of this.
            function is also of type <code>Int</code>. If you apply a function with a different type, say you String,
            the compiler of Haskell can find this error and tell you that you need to fix it. Programming languages like
            JavaScript and Python (if not type annotated) does not have this feature. Programming languages like C/C++
            and Java may implicitly convert a type into another type. They are not safe. The latter may sound considerate,
            but may lead to an expected behavior.
